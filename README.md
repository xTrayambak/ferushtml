# ferushtml/2html5you -- a standards compliant, browser-grade, flexible, fast and secure HTML parser for Ferus
There's not much to be seen here.
In the future there will be a consume-based parser, but for now only a FSM parser is available.
ferushtml is designed to be able to abstract Ferus' codebase, whilst still maintaining 1:1 compatibility with src/parsers/html in Ferus
